# Our website info

You can update this page if you wish

Everytime you submit a piece of code/update a piece of code, we need to find a way to make sure we dont submit it as the same time
Otherwise, we may overwrite the new code we both uploaded

All the code should be inside the Web Folder of the repository

# RECOMMENDED

It is HIGHLY recommended that you install github desktop for live code dispatches to update the website, rather than copying and pasting each section bit by bit
